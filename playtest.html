								<h2>INSTRUCTIONS for REINSCRIPTION of our STRUGGLE FOR UTOPIA</h2>
								<p>As transcribed from The Free Earth archive by the delegates to the Assembly for the Future</p>
								<div class="spotlight"><span class="image"><img src="images/Ancient Future-Retroistic Data Storage Device.png" alt="Personae Card back">
								<span>Fig. 1. The Free Earth archive, 02025. The diamond-obsidian composite cold-storage device passed down to us by our ancestors documenting humanity's legacies of freedom.</span>
								</span>
								<p style="text-align: left">[Excerpts from the Technical Manual to The Free Earth Archive]<br/>
								The following techniques will allow future generations to remember, learn, and participate in humanity's legacy of freedom. Through these techniques, The Archive grows as it is reinscribed. The struggle for utopia is a continuous process that demands from any so bold as to fight for it a memory of the joys and despairs our Ancestors found. There are only very narrow pathways to maintaining the utopian process. Struggle in solidarity for utopia now. Good Luck!</p></div>
								
								<h2>Technique 001: Festival of Remembarance</h2>
								<p>The Assembly members find themselves at a “Festival of Remembrance” where they remember how each of their Ancestors (Personae) came together to overcome the challenges of the world before. The Assembly must project their minds backward into the past we've lost to secure the utopia we've won.</p>
								<p class="bold">The goal of this technique is to collectively “remember” one of the stories that built our utopia so that our utopia can continue.</p>
								<p>The following are abbreviated rules. See the <a href="assets/Solarpunk Futures Game Booklet-v0.2.pdf">full game book</a> for more details and optional rules and game modes.</p>
								<p class="content">
									<span class="bold">01. THE CHALLENGE</span><br/>
									Draw one Challenge card as a group.<br/><br/>
									Someone begins with: “When we overcame the Challenge of ______, I remember...”. The group collectively describes the nature of the challenge and what made it so difficult to overcome.<br/><br/>
									The starting world is assumed to be very similar to the players’ present world.<br/><br/>
									<span class="bold">02. THE ANCESTORS</span><br/>
									Each player remembers an ancestor by drawing one Personae, one Value, and two Tool cards.<br/><br/>
									Set a five-minute timer for each player to write down their Ancestor’s name, background, and how they first approached the Challenge. Since they won't fully overcome the challenge until the next phase, be sure to think about where they came up short and/or which powers opposed them.<br/><br/>
									After the timer is up, someone begins by sharing their Ancestor's story up until they met the other Ancestors (in the next phase).<br/>
									<br/>
									<span class="bold">03. BUILDING THE NEW WORLD</span><br/>
									Collectively tell the story of what roadblocks they encountered and how the Ancestors came together to overcome the challenge.<br/><br/>
									<span class="column-list">
										Explain how your ancestor collaborated with another or were inspired by one another to come closer to overcoming the challenge.<br/>
										Explain what brought all the ancestors together and one of the things they decided as a group.<br/>
										Explain how those perpetuating The Challenge responded to your efforts, and how the ancestors came together to counter them.<br/>
										Explain how the world looked after your anscestor's intervention.
									</span><br/><br/>
									Someone ends this phase at any time by declaring "We honor our Ancestors for their struggle". The group uses modified consensus to determine if they are finished.
									<br/><br/>
									<span class="bold">04. REMEMBRANCE</span><br/>
									In no particular order, each player answers at least one :<br/><br/>
									<span class="column-list">
										What might have gone differently?<br/>
										How long did it take? Could it have taken a much longer or shorter time?<br/>
										Were you able to fully overcome the Challenge, or just the worst of it? <br/>
										Which groups of people joined your efforts?<br/>
										What is being done today, in the utopia, to actively mitigate against it arising again?<br/>
										What other Tools and Values could have been used?<br/>
										What risks did these ancestors have to take? Did they need to make sacrifices?<br/>
										How do you think these Personae felt when they were faced with this Challenge?<br/>
										Do any of the possibilities you envisioned challenge, affirm, or clarify your current real-world impact?<br/>
										Were you inspired by any of the scenarios you explored?</br/>
										Who are some real-world people today facing this same Challenge that you hope will be remembered by future generations?<br/>
										How would this story have been told differently if it was: a superhero action movie, a dystopian novel, a satire/comedy, a romance, or another genre?<br/>
