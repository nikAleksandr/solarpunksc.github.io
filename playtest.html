								<h2>REPORT of the DATA-RECOVERY TEAM ON THE ANCIENT DATA-STORAGE ANOMALY</h2>
								<p>Pursuant to request of the delegates to the Assembly for the Future</p>
								<div class="spotlight"><span class="image"><img src="images/Ancient Future-Retroistic Data Storage Device.png" alt="Personae Card back">
								<span>Fig. 1. The Relic, an 8 Bn year-old diamond-obsidian composite data-storage device (discovered March 02023)</span>
								</span>
								<p style="text-align: left">[Excerpts from report for assembly delegates]<br/>
								*Radio-carbon dating report* <br/>
								Despite extremely advanced information-density, The Relic appears to be older than our best estimates for the age of the Earth — by a factor of 2. <br/>
								*Author's Executive Summary*<br/>
								The techniques enclosed were all that was able to be recovered and reassembled from The Relic, which is confirmed to function as an information storage device similar to our hard drives — though for what kind of computer, we can only speculate. It appears to contain a set of instructions for us (!!!)  for...our future. Much of the information was corrupted. Our team has done their best to recreate instructions in the following report. The Relic included this address to this assembly, by name: “There is a narrow pathway to our future. Struggle in solidarity for utopia now, there’s not much time!” Good Luck</p></div>
								
								<h2>Technique 001: Festival of Remembarance</h2>
								<p>The Assembly must project their minds forward into a group of individuals already living in the future we’ve won. These future individuals find themselves at a “Festival of Remembrance” where they remember how each of their Ancestors (Personae) came together to overcome the challenges of the world before.</p>
								<p class="bold">The goal of this technique is to collectively “remember” one of the stories that built our utopia so that it can guide our actions in the present.</p>
								<p>The following are abbreviated rules. See the <a href="assets/Solarpunk Futures Game Booklet-v0.2.pdf">full game book</a> for more details and optional rules and game modes.</p>
								<p class="content">
									<span class="bold">01. THE CHALLENGE</span><br/>
									Draw one Challenge card as a group.<br/>
									Someone begins with: “I remember when we overcame the worst of _____”. The group describes it in more detail.<br/>
									The starting world is assumed to be very similar to the players’ present world.<br/><br/>
									<span class="bold">02. THE ANCESTORS</span><br/>
									Set a two-minute timer after each player draws one Personae, one Value, and two Tool cards to remember an Ancestor.<br/>
									Describe the Ancestor’s name, background, and how they first approached the Challenge. *They won't fully overcome the challenge until the next phase.*<br/><br/>
									<span class="bold">03. BUILDING THE NEW WORLD</span><br/>
									Collectively tell the story of what roadblocks they encountered and how the Ancestors came together to overcome the challenge.<br/><br/>
									<span class="bold">04. REMEMBRANCE</span><br/>
									Each player answers at least one :<br/>
										What might have gone differently?<br/>
										How long did it take? Could it have taken a much longer or shorter time?<br/>
										Were you able to fully overcome the Challenge, or just the worst of it? <br/>
										What is being done today, in the utopia, to actively mitigate against it arising again?<br/>
										What other Tools and Values could have been used?<br/>
										How do you think these Personae felt when they were faced with this Challenge?<br/>
										Do any of the possibilities you envisioned challenge, affirm, or clarify your current real-world impact?<br/>
										Were you inspired by any of the scenarios you explored?</br/>
										Who are some real-world people today facing this same Challenge that you hope will be remembered by future generations?<br/>
										How would this story have been told differently if it was: a superhero action movie, a dystopian novel, a satire/comedy, a romance, or another genre?<br/>
