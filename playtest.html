								<h2>GUIDELINES for the REINSCRIPTION of our STRUGGLE FOR UTOPIA</h2>
								<p>As transcribed from The Free Earth Archive by the delegates to the Assembly for the Future</p>
								<div class="spotlight"><span class="image"><img src="images/Ancient Future-Retroistic Data Storage Device.png" alt="Ancestor Card back">
								<span>Fig. 1. The Free Earth Archive, 02025. Passed down to us by our ancestors, this archive documents humanity's legacies of freedom. It is an example of extremely durable mid-century diamond-obsidian composite cold-storage technology.</span>
								</span>
								<p style="text-align: left">[Excerpts from the Technical Manual to The Free Earth Archive]<br/><br/>
								Living now, in our free society, we must honor our Ancestor's for their struggle. This is not just an ethical imperative, but the only practical method for maintaining the process of utopia. For the struggle for utopia is a continuous process that demands, from any so bold as to fight for it, a memory of the joys and despairs our Ancestors found.<br/><br/>
								The following techniques will allow future generations to remember, learn, and participate in humanity's legacy of freedom. Through these techniques, The Free Earth Archive grows as it is reinscribed. <br/><br/>
								</p></div>
								
								<h2>Technique 001: Festival of Remembarance</h2>
								<p>You have all been chosen as members of The Assembly for the Future. It is your sacred task to lead the opening of the “Festival of Remembrance” where you collectively remember how each of your Ancestors came together to overcome the Challenges of the world before. The Assembly must project your minds backward into one pivotal moment of our past to secure the utopia we've won.</p>
								<p class="bold">The goal of this technique is to collectively “remember” one of the stories that grew our utopia.</p>
								<p>The following are abbreviated rules. See the <a href="assets/Solarpunk Futures Game Booklet-v0.2.pdf">full game book</a> for more details and optional rules and game modes.</p>
								<p class="content">
									<span class="bold">01. THE CHALLENGE</span><br/>
									Draw one Challenge card as a group.<br/><br/>
									Someone begins with: “When we overcame the Challenge of ______, I remember...”. Everyone goes around the circle collectively describing the nature of the challenge and why it was so daunting.<br/><br/>
									The starting world is assumed to be very similar to the players’ present world.<br/><br/>
									<span class="example">
										<span class="bold">Example of Play</span><br/>
										<span class="meta">The group draws the Challenge of homelessness.</span><br/>
										Colette: When we overcame the Challenge of homelessness, I remember that people without homes were often very isolated from other people who weren’t homeless. It made it extra hard to find work and services and resources.<br/>
										Beau: I remember how infuriating it was that people were denied shelter because they were denied the ability to do good work for decent wages. Plenty of people were looking for work and just kept out of the economy.<br/>
										Alyssum: Yeah, and there were tons of people who had more than one home, but there was so much scarcity on everyone’s minds, no one ever considered just transferring all those unoccupied homes to people who needed shelter.
									</span><br/><br/>
									<span class="bold">02. THE ANCESTORS</span><br/>
									Each player remembers an Ancestor by drawing one Ancestor, one Value, and two Tool cards.<br/><br/>
									Set a five-minute timer for each player to write down their Ancestor’s name, background, and how they first approached the Challenge. Since they won't fully overcome the Challenge until the next phase, be sure to think about where they came up short and/or which powers opposed them.<br/><br/>
									After the timer is up, someone begins by sharing their Ancestor's story up until they met the other Ancestors (in the next phase).<br/>
									<br/>
									<span class="example">
										<span class="bold">Example of Play</span><br/>
										<span class="meta">Alyssum draws a Coordinator Ancestor card, a value of biomimicry, and tools of land rights and graffiti. After the five-minute timer goes off, the group checks if everyone is ready and Nick volunteers to share first.</span><br/>
										Alyssum: Alicia was an etymologist programmer who studied social insect behaviors. They utilized their knowledge and inspiration to design de-centralized algorithms on the blockchain for purchasing and combining tracts of cheap, vacant, and foreclosed land and returning that land to the commons. Those common lands are marked by a “Free Earth” graffiti tag for all to know and use as commons. Unfortunately, the resources to purchase this land were limited, and Alicia’s group was only able to purchase a lot of poor, degraded, even poisoned land, and much of it remained disconnected from other tracts.
									</span><br/><br/>
									<span class="bold">03. BUILDING THE NEW WORLD</span><br/>
									Collectively tell the story of what roadblocks they encountered and how the Ancestors came together to overcome the challenge.<br/><br/>
									<span class="column-list">
										Explain how your Ancestor collaborated with another or were inspired by one another to come closer to overcoming the challenge.<br/>
										Explain what brought all the Ancestors together and one of the things they decided as a group.<br/>
										Explain how those perpetuating The Challenge responded to your efforts, and how the Ancestors came together to counter them.<br/>
										Explain how the world looked after your Ancestor's intervention.
									</span><br/><br/>
									Someone ends this phase at any time by declaring "We honor our Ancestors for their struggle". The group uses modified consensus to determine if they are finished.
									<br/><br/>
									<span class="example">
										<span class="bold">Example of Play</span><br/>
										<span class="meta">In the previous rounds, Colette remembered her Ancestor, Chris, who created a small-scale, replicable holistic community planning model. Beau remembered their Ancestor, Barbara, who was living  on the streets when they created a timebank that built important community connections and power among the homeless. And Alyssum remembered her Ancestor, Alicia, who used an algorithm to buy up cheap and vacant lands and turn them into commons.</span><br/>
										Alyssum: I think the vacant lands could start to become more than just the idea of commons if they had some of Chris’ community plans.<br/>
										Beau: The timebank could even help coordinate people to provide labor to help build the communities and people who need shelter and community to live in.<br/>
										Alyssum: Maybe Chris could use these as experiments to improve the community plans, too.<br/>
										Colette: I like that idea. I think the plans improve toward more community self-sufficiency and the communities share the improvements as they spread. We could figure out a lot of self-sufficient energy systems with more help and expertise.<br/>
										Beau: The timebank could also start lending tools and knowledge as it gained actual physical infrastructure in these communities.<br/>
										<span class="meta">The group continues until someone declares that “We’ve honored the struggle of our Ancestors” and the rest of the group agrees.</span>
									</span><br/><br/>
									<span class="bold">04. REMEMBRANCE</span><br/>
									In no particular order, each player answers at least one:<br/><br/>
									<span class="column-list">
										What might have gone differently?<br/>
										How long did it take? Could it have taken a much longer or shorter time?<br/>
										Were you able to fully overcome the Challenge, or just the worst of it? <br/>
										Which groups of people joined your efforts?<br/>
										What is being done today, in the utopia, to actively mitigate against it arising again?<br/>
										What other Tools and Values could have been used?<br/>
										What risks did these ancestors have to take? Did they need to make sacrifices?<br/>
										How do you think these Ancestors felt when they were faced with this Challenge?<br/>
										Do any of the possibilities you envisioned challenge, affirm, or clarify your current real-world impact?<br/>
										Were you inspired by any of the scenarios you explored?</br/>
										Who are some real-world people today facing this same Challenge that you hope will be remembered by future generations?<br/>
										How would this story have been told differently if it was: a superhero action movie, a dystopian novel, a satire/comedy, a romance, or another genre?<br/>
