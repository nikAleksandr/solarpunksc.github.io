											<h2>Build the Future</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Solarpunk Futures is a 10-minute rules-light role playing game where players imagine building a desirable world from the perspective of a utopian future. Players use a deck of cards to adopt Personae (e.g. grower, engineer, newcomer) and work together using Tools (e.g. recycled materials, equipment library, off-grid energy) and Values (e.g. care, responsibility, usufruct) to overcome a set of real-world Challenges (e.g. borders, ableist infrastructure, climate refugee crisis). Through dialogue and collaborative worldbuilding, collective and visionary narratives emerge of a new society, along with plausible scenarios for how to get there.</p>

									<h2>Solarpunk?</h2>
									<p>Solarpunk is a visionary utopian politics and aesthetic that embraces the reality of capitalism catastrophe while maintaining a radical optimism about humanity's hopes for a communal, ecological future.</p>
									<p>It's a restorative justice process at a planetary scale —— among people and between humans and non-human nature. That means reclaiming pieces of pre-capitalist culture, material accountability for old practices and radical adaptability toward new ones, all while maintaining a utopian and ecological vision for the potentialities of our interrelations in the present.

									<h2>How it works</h2>
									<p>The game revolves around four sets of cards. Each player gets a Personae and at least one Tool, and Value. The players collectively face a Challenge.<br/>

									The players take turns imagining from their utopian future how their Personae engaged in the struggle. In a conversation that can range from solemn to comical in tone, the players decide collectively how they worked together and why it took all of them to overcome the challenge.</p>

								<p class="content">Whether players have known each other for a long time or they are strangers playing together at a free artist-hosted session, games are a strong way to fight social isolation and allow us to let our defenses down and dream. All of this can happen with friends over Zoom during COVID, but the focus of this game is on socially distant (as long as that’s relevant) real-life environments — in a library, a park, over an outdoor dinner table, or at a coffee shop.<br/><br/>

								Solarpunk Futures will be relevant to activists, educators and librarians, artists and performers, nonprofits, and existing community groups as a fun and engaging way to build teamwork and bring people together around compelling visions of the future. We anticipate the game will appeal to an intergenerational mix of teens and adults who will play with their families, in schools and other places of education, in parks, libraries, and other public spaces.<br/><br/>

								Players can gain connections with one another and engage in fun speculative utopianism to broaden their own ideas. In the longer term, we hope this game inspires people to take immediate action in their communities to bring about the futures they imagined.</p>
